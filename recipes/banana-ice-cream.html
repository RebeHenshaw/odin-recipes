      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>First off, what is nice cream? Well if you’ve visited the world wide web at any point since 2015, you’ve 
      probably heard of it. You know, the frozen banana deliciousness that’s been giving ice cream a run for its 
      money. Bananas are naturally creamy and sweet, making it the perfect base for “guilt-free” dairy-free ice cream.</p>
      <p>The concept is simple: freeze sweet and nutritious bananas, then blend them up until they form a creamy, 
        dreamy mock ice cream.</p>
      <p>And for a food lover who studied both nutrition and sensory science, this recipe is basically a unicorn 
        for me the best of all worlds!</p>
