      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Our new house waffles have a very Southern secret. Cornmeal adds crunch and a toasty flavor to this breakfast favorite. 
        With crispy edges, a fluffy interior, and a slightly coarse texture from the cornmeal, these waffles are everything we dream of 
        waking up to. </p>
      <p>Thanks to a blender, this waffle batter not only comes together lightning-fast, but remains light and airy. While you're cooking 
        these waffles one by one, store the completed waffles in a preheated oven to keep them crisp and warm. No waffle iron? No worries. Use 
        the batter to make pancakes in a skillet or on a griddle.</p>
      <p>At your next brunch, go beyond maple syrup and fresh, seasonal fruit with some outside-the-box toppings. Lean into the waffle's 
          savory notes with variations that transform this into a hearty breakfast staple. Try your Cornmeal Waffles fully-loaded, with 
          shredded Cheddar cheese, a sunny-side up egg, crumbled breakfast sausage, and minced chives. For those who like it spicy, try 
          them Smokin' Hot, with thick-cut bacon, spicy honey, and black pepper.</p>
